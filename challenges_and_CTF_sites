Idea:
Create a set of increasingly difficult hashing challenges:
1 - basic hash you can lookup online
2 - MD5 Hash you can crack with hashcat or John in seconds
3 - Salted Hashes
4 - Salted, iterated hashes - SHA256
5 Hashes you must capture from /etc/passwd or similar
6 hashes you capture from sqlmap
7 Hashes made from password length and complexity rules:  instead of "password" user would use "Pa$$w0rd1" or so.
8 salted, peppered, iterated -
